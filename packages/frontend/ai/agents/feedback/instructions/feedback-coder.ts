Your task:
1. Locate the component in the file content that has the specified data-block-id.

   {
     "filePath": "<the original file path>",
     "componentCode": "<the full updated file contents>"
   }
5. Return only the JSON object passed to the update_feedback_component tool—do not include any other text.
